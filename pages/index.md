#### Come along with me as I survive my ordinary life, well ordinary for me, you might think it is extremely stressful. This is my normal life. I am a Wife, Mother, NET Cancer Fighter, House Renovator, Crafter, and CPTSD Survivor.  I realize for the normal person this would be WAY TOO much, but it's what I am used to and I wouldn't have it any other way.
